# Post

This is my first blogpost. I previously intended to build this website using Jekyll, since that's the default when using
GitHub pages. However Jekyll is a pain to use on Windows, so I decided to use Astro. Two main reasons, one is that it's
apparently good for developing a simple website, and two is that it lets me practice JS and React, which seem to be the 
modern standard for web technologies.
